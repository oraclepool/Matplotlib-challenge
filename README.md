Observations and Insights
1. The bar graph showed the Drug Regimen Capomulin has the maximum mice number (230), and Zoniferol has the smaller mice number (182).By removing duplicates the total number of mice is 248. The total count of mice by gender also showed that 124 female mice and 125 male mice.
2. The correlation between mouse weight, and average tumor volume is 0.84. It is a strong positive correlation, when the mouse weight increases the average tumor volume also increases.
3. The regression analysis helped us to understand how much the average tumor volume (dependent variable) will change when weight of mice change(independent variables). The R-squared value is 0.70, which means 70% the model fit the data, wich is fairely good to predict the data from the model. Higher R-squared values represent smaller differences between the observed data, and the fitted value. 70% the model explains all of the variation in the response variable around its mean.
4. From the selected treatments Capomulin and Ramicane reduces the size of tumors better.
